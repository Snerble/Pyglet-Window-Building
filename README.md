# Pyglet-Window-Building
A Python project made from scratch that aims to become a complete window building system, such as Java's Swing package or Android studio. 

Originally, this project was just about interfacing with a specific website's API, but I decided I wanted an interface for it. This snowballed into making a complete framework for building interfaces in Python, using the pyglet package.

Progress on this project is slow and commits aren't pushed consistently. This is mostly because I have no idea what I am making and simply prototyping and testing stuff until something works really well. My goal is to make this system as intuitive as possible, while also focussing on performance. This means I have to abstract a lot of things in just the right way and so far progress on that is slow.<br>
Besides that, this is a hobby project, so school and work tends to get in the way. I do enjoy working on it from time to time and every so often a commit comes around with 1500 changes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
