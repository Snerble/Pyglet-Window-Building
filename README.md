# Pyglet-Window-Building
A Python project made from scratch that aims to become a complete window building system, such as Java's Swing package or Android studio. 

Originally, this project was just about interfacing with a specific website's API, but I decided I wanted an interface for it. This snowballed into making a complete framework for building interfaces in Python, using the pyglet package.
